# DSPD-sem4-project
Developed Train seat allocation model using concepts of Data structures and algorithms, majorly used linked lists for storing data.

Implement the following system using a linked list of structures where every node of that list 
represents a record of passenger name, passenger id, boarding train, boarding station, 
travelling class(Sleeper, 3AC, 2AC, 1AC), destination station, train id, Seat number (bogie 
number/seat number), and any other field you think that would be useful to passengers. You 
can also take a confirmation from the passenger whether upgrade of travel class is desired.
